It is expected that hard or semihard parton scatterings with transverse momentum of a few GeV are expected to dominate high energy heavy ion collisions. HIJING (Heavy Ion Jet INteraction Generator) Monte Carlo model was developed by M. Gyulassy and X.-N. Wang with special emphasis on the role of minijets in pp, pA and AA reactions at collider energies.
Detailed systematic comparison of HIJING results with a very wide range of data demonstrates that a quantitative understanding of the interplay between soft string dynamics and hard QCD interaction has been achieved. In particular, HIJING reproduces many inclusive spectra two particle correlations, and can explain the observed flavor and multiplicity dependence of the average transverse momentum.

We plan to continue investigating a variety of physics topics with HIJING including pA to dihadron reactions and back-to-back two-particle correlations. The long range objective is to develop a space-time parton shower program that utilizes HIJING as the initial condition prior to hadronization. This latter development should be coupled to both the field theoretic studies of dE/dx described in the next section. The space-time cascade can only be done after a proper understanding of how interference phenomena leading to the Landau-Pomeronchuck-Migdal effect can be included in a classical cascade simulation.
