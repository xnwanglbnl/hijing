HIJING/B-anti-B is composed of the following 4 source files hijing1.34.bb.f,
hipyset.bb.f, junction.f and xhijing.bb.f.

A sample Makefile is included for compilation of the program. Note that the
link to the libraries will probably need to be changed.

Once compiled, execute the command 'hijbb < input > output' to run the
program.

To simulate p+p collisions at sqrt{s} = 28 GeV or Pb+Pb collisions at E_lab =
160 GeV/c use the following sample input files, pp28.dat and pbpb160l.dat,
respectively.



The program would require cernlib libraries, that can be obtained from
https://github.com/apc-llc/cernlib
